Trim Tags From Virtual Machines
===============================
-   Azure Resources and Resource Groups have a limit of 15 tags. In order to make additional tags space on a set of resources, this action can be used to remove enough tags to make the desired amount of space while preserving a given set of tags. Setting space to 0 will remove all tags not listed to preserve.
